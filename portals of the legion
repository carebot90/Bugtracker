Minor issue

 

Activating a portal is fine, mob spawns as should and kil gives credit. Issue is portal resets to unused state within a few seconds. Blizzard had this set at around 5-10 minutes to stay in a used state.

 

As currently is quest is far too easy requiring a camp of the one portal once only
