Hey,

 

This was once already an issue and it was rejected though it is still probelmatic.

There are two quest:
http://db.excalibur-wow.com/?quest=1079

http://db.excalibur-wow.com/?quest=1080

 

You can complete these two quests by acquiring two quest items only the fun part is setting up explosives and blowing them up remotlely so that you make a distraction for the Venture co. members and u can sneak up to these two items and steal them without being in any danger.

 

 

 

2 problems there are:

 

(1)

You need to achieve two other quests in order to get both of these. This is issue one, because now if u complete only one of them u can get both Covert Ops quest.

 

Pre-quests:
http://db.excalibur-wow.com/?quest=1077

http://db.excalibur-wow.com/?quest=1074

 

(2)

In these Covert Ops quest. (Alpha/Beta) you need to set an explosive at a wagon, and an other explosive at an other wagon. At each wagons after gaining a little distance you need to trigger the explosives by a remote controller.
The problem is that even though you can set the explosives you cant trigger them from the distance. It says: "Requires NG-5 explosives Red/Blue" - depending on which explosive you wanna blow up.
 

The wagons where you set the explosives:

and the items you get for these two quest:

http://db.excalibur-wow.com/?item=5738

 

 

The two items' coordiantes:

http://db.excalibur-wow.com/?object=19603

 

This is from where those mobs should head to those two wagons so that the area be clear of hostile creatures, because now there are plenty of them around and its really hard to acquire those items alone.
