During the quest Shadoweaver (Tailoring quest in Searing Gorge), the player should be able to talk to the infernal next to Nilith Lokrav (Raze) and get him to assist in completing the quest. Interacting with Raze while on the Shadoweave quest should give players a control rod (Staff of Command) that they could use to get the infernal to attack the poachers. Also, talking to Raze while having the quest should get him to follow the player.
