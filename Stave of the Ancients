 The quest is part of the chain that starts from the item http://db.excalibur.ws/?item=18703 dropped from Majordomo Executus in Molten Core, quest text is here: http://db.excalibur.ws/?quest=7636

The neutral npcs are present in the world, and if you have the quest in your log you should be able to challenge them and kill them in order to complete it and turn in to receive the epic item: http://db.excalibur.ws/?item=18707 , necessary to create the epic vanilla bow and staff for hunter. The problem is that even with the quest you can't challenge them, nobody of them.
