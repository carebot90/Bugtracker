Apprentice Mirveda located at 54,70

 

We should talk to her to complete q, and take next part from her.

ISSUE: Can't talk to her. No yellow question mark on her etc.

 

Link to q and there is also video how it should work: http://www.wowhead.com/quest=9254/the-wayward-apprentice 



Notable Comments : If this bug is the same as the old one, she no longer talks to you once you hit level 10. I completed the chain when I was level 8 on my Warlock.
