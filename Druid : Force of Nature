Just copy pasting this bug, confirmed not marked as fixed. 




Treants does not attack nearby enemies unless their master is attacked by someone (simillar to Hunters defensive stance) or summoned incredibly close to a target.

 

This can be easily tested summoning them on top of a training dummy, as they are non-aggressive and thus the treants will not attack the target dummy. They will however respond to a target that is flagged as an enemy, for example another player in a duel.

"Bc_icon.gif?version=9c5ea86df0b5f667b91d Patch 2.1.0 (2007-05-22):

    These pets will now come into the game with full health, including that gained from a percentage of their master's stamina.
    The Treants summoned by this spell will now correctly attack your target even if it is neutral or non-aggressive."

Force of Nature should attack the target focused by the summoner, not pick a random target. If there are more than 1 target in the area they cannot be controlled of who to attack.

This should also improve their overall usefulness in PvP, as they pick a random target and chase it until the summoner leaves combat or they die.

The treants damage is reported in the combat log but it is not displayed on my screen. I dont know why but I wanted to leave a note about it in case it could be fixed as well. It makes it very hard to determine how much damage they actually contribute to a fight.
