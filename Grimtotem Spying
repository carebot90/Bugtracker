This quest requires the player to collect three secret reports from three separate locations. The first location worked as it should and gives the first report. However, the second location inside the main tent in the main area of the Darkcloud Pinnacle gives the player any of the three they are missing every time they open the box. So, if the player were to head to this box before gaining the first report, they would be given the first report, then be able to collect the second, and finally the third from that same box. I did have GM Mercus online and they tested it to find that it was true. They requested that I put in a report of this bug issue. The specific box location coordinates are 39.3, 41.5. This occurance took place on Jan. 30th, 2018 roughly at 1am Pacific time.
