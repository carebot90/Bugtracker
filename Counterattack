 Fortunately, this one is simple. The quest 'Counterattack!' is the last of a chain in The Barrens. It is located west of The Crossroads with the quest giver in a bunker. When a player accepts the quest, it should trigger a bunch or horde Orc warriors and Troll axethrower NPC's as well as a bunch of centaur surrounding an elite mob who is the target of this quest, but only the elite mob spawns.

 

The centaur should charge one at a time into the player and their allies, and when the non-elites are dead, the elite mob charges in. Looting his corpse completes the quest.

 

Not too complicated, and the quest is a load of fun. I'm disappointed I couldn't partake in it.
