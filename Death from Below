Atm, It's impossible to complete this quest, I got quest but the nagas never came, I abandoned the quest, relogged (deleted cache folder) and retook it, waited from 10:08 am ST to 10:30, but nothing happened. The event is not working at all.

    I did this on my mage and paladin (both lvl 41) yesterday and both times it was bugged. On my mage, I didn't realize I was supposed to man the cannon, so I waited on the ground by the captain and the soldiers. The naga never came so I reread the quest and then noticed that I was supposed to get on the cannon. I found it, fired it once and the quest completed. The naga never came.

    Just did this quest today, no nagas spawned and the quest completed.

    at the moment the nagas are not spawning at all. nothing happens for a few mins and you then get quest complete.

    rofl, HUGE glitch. i started the quest, went to cannon immediately, watched the ogre go up the hill and run back. i waited for about a minute and no naga came. i got off the boat and i completed the quest, rofl.

    Same here. I fired the cannon a few times, hit nothing, and the quest was completed.
