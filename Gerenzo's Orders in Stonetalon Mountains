The quest Gerenzo's Orders, found in Stonetalon Mountains->Windshear Mine, given by the goblin called Piznik doe not work properly.

After Piznik gives the quest, he just continues on mining the same slot as he was earlier, without doing anything for the quest.

He never gives the required item inorder to finish the quest.
