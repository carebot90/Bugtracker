-After obtaining honored with O'grila one should be able to pick up a quest for Crystalforged Darkrune, which can be used on Felguard Degrader roaming around the shartuul's transporter in blades edge, which starts the daily event to summon Shartuul.

 

-Currently there is no mob at all.

 

-This event is quite important for druids, because it has very nice chance to drop Depleted Badge ( => Badge of Tenacity)

also its rated as one of the most fun quests to do in WoW history, so its quite a shame that it doesnt work :P

 

Hopefully it will be possible to fix it.
