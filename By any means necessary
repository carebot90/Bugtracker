I had to fight him, but the fight was really easy. After you fight him he will have a yellow question mark above his head for you to complete the quest.


You have to fight Empoor while he is helped by his "Bodyguard" to get a yellow mark above Empoor head and deliver the quest take next etc.

Just did this one. You can ignore the bodygaurd, they will both turn friendly again after you take Empoor down to %1. A
 

 

Bodyguard does not have to be killed but he will attack too.
