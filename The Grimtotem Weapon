Bon:


Sometimes when you kill the mobs under the totem debuff, they don't count towards the progression of your quest.

In fact, I killed at least 8 before I got 1/10.

 

2 of the reasons I found:

1. You have to last hit the mob in order for it to count. When my pet makes a killing blow, the mob doesn't count to me.

2. The totem debuff sometimes disappears for a second or two. I saw this while standing without attacking the crocodile, but I'm not sure if that's actually one of the reasons.

 

It also seems like you need to stay near the corpse when you kill it, so that this dark piece of something enters your body (that's when you get the quest to count, not when you kill the mob).

 

Screenshot:

You can see that this dark soul (the skull) is flying towards my pet, not towards me. So it didn't count. Actually, quite a lucky screenshot to show what I mean.

I have around 10 screenshots with mobs dead on the ground near the totem and the quest progression telling me I still have 1/10, if needed.
