 This is the 2nd quest with the same name. The goal is to defend Commander Gor'shak from waves of enemies.

What does happen: Nothing. After accepting quest, nothing happens.

What should happen: After accepting the quest, a wave of npc should immediately enter the room and attack the players/Gor'shak npc.
This problem seems to be old, quest report shows not working as of 600+ days ago.
