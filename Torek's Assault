When you pick up the quest, Torek starts moving to Silverwing Outpost without his Splintertree Raiders. According to older Wowhead comments, the Raiders are supposed to follow him on the escort, but in this case they don't, which makes the quest difficult to complete without a group.
 
I've this issue on two different occasions: A few months ago (around July, I'm guessing) and just last weekend (October). These are the only times I've done the quest on this server.
