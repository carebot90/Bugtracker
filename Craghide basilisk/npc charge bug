The bug was reported for this npc: Craghide basilisk

to my knowledge its a bug specific for that npc, a mob that can charge and does that on a flying player close enough to the ground (very precise height from the ground) will have the npc continuously reset and recharge on the target making the player stuck in a stun loop.
