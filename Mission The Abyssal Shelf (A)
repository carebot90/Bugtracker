The bug regards the item " Area 52 Special" the item is a conjured item that lasts for 60 minutes and is only usable in the Abyssal Shelf area
 
What happens with this item is that it deals 60k damage to enemies in the area that it is thrown but it affects horde players aswell as the enemies resulting in a instant kill on players. I believe that it shouldn't be usable against players (To my knowledge it never has ¬.¬) 
 
As of posting this is when it was encountered
