after completing Hero of the Mag'har quest chain ([url="http://www.wowhead.com/quest=10212"]http://www.wowhead.com/quest=10212[/url]) a cutscene should happen, where Thrall comes to Garadar, meets her grandmother and talks with Garrosh Hellscream about his father. None of that happens here, thrall spawns but has no skin, only patrolling between eastern gate and inn and none of dialogues happen.
