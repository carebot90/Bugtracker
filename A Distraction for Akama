picking up this quest should start a scripted event, where forces of aldors, scryers and xiÂ´ri do attack on demon forces infront of black temple while akama and maiev sneak behind them into the entrance.

Currently none of this happens, aldors and scryers forces are just spawned there staticly (they shouldnt) and also attack players of opposite faction (which they shouldnt, they also always attack anyone who uses the neck) and quest gets autocomplete after pretty long amount of time without any event actually happening.
